During the pandemic, the stock market in Taiwan was prospers, especially for those speculated stocks. They were highly overvalued, but at the same time were highly profitable. Therefore, I built this model to make sure those company will not bankrupt while facing panic, to reduce the risk of buying speculated stocks for those people like me, someone not knowing much about financial statement. So the only purpose of this project is to lower the risk of buying speculated stocks, as long as the company is not bankrupt, there are chances for the price to raise.
